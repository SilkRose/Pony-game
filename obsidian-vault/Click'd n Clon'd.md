# Click'd n Clon'd

Click'd n Clon'd is a [[Clicker]] game, where you cllick a pony to make [[Friends]], and a bit to make [[Bits]].

The game will start with you making your charector, selecting coat and mane color, mane and tail styles, eye color, race, gender, etc.

Once the charector has been made, a cinematic will play showing the player searching for and finding the [[Pool of amalgamations]].

The [[Pool of amalgamations]] is a magical pool of water that clones the player when they enter it speaking a specfic chant. These [[Clones]] need to be managed and are the pawns you use to make all your [[Friends]] by sending them to [[Events]], and having them work in your [[Buildings]].

The [[Pool of amalgamations]] is a [[Mini-game]], there are several mini-games to play, but the player must unlock them by buying [[Buildings]] or going to [[Events]].

After cloning yourself one time the side panels slide in, the left one being the [[Clicker]], and the right one being [[Events]] and [[Buildings]].

[[Events]] cost [[Bits]] and [[Clones]], and generate [[Friends]]. [[Buildings]] cost [[Bits]] and [[Clones]] to work them, and generate [[Bits]] and small amounts of [[Friends]].

Now the player must start clicking either the pony to make [[Friends]] or the bit to make [[Bits]].

Once the player has enough [[Bits]] they can go to there first event, at this event they start making [[Friends]] per second or fps for short. While there the player can play a [[Mini-game]] to earn more [[Friends]]and [[Bits]].

At the start the player makes very little fps and bps, as they go to more events and buy more buildings and make more clones these go up.

After some time the player can start automating the proccess of making [[Clones]], at a slow rate to begin with.

Once the player has enough [[Bits]] and a [[Clones]] to run it, they can purchase a [[Newspaper stand]]. this [[Buildings]] generates [[Bits]] from customers and a small portion of [[Friends]] from loyal customers.

The [[Newspaper stand]] contains a [[Mini-game]], over time the player will decide what news to print, they can either print the news factually or alter it to meet there needs.
